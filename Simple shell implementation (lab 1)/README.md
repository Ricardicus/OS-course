# simple shell implementation

Parses input and calls programs with their arguments using UNIX system commands such as: fork, execv
Also supports the shell builtin: cd 

Can of course be extended! 
Does what the shell does best but is not a programming language. 

# Pipes, I/O redirection, background foreground etc.. :) 

Looking at the PATH variable to see where binaries can reside..
