# Efforts from a good course in Operating Systems 

Thanks to a very competent teacher we explored many interesting concepts
related to operating systems in a course at LTH. I am not going to 
share the course name because someone might google it and github 
and come here and steal me and my friends solutions. 

The guru i meantioned has a name but for the same reasons as above
I choose to give a link to his personal web site where one can read
what courses he gives: http://www.jonasskeppstedt.net/courses/. 
In that way if you are interested in knowing more about the course
you can find out by yourself from there on.
