# Efforts from a good course in Operating Systems 

Thanks to a very competent teacher we explored many interesting concepts
related to operating systems in a course at LTH. I am not going to 
share the course name because someone might google it and github 
and come here and steal mine and my friends solutions. 

For the same reasons as above I choose to give a link to the teachers web site 
where one can read what courses he gives: http://www.jonasskeppstedt.net/courses/. 
In that way if you are interested in knowing more about the course
you can learn by yourself.
